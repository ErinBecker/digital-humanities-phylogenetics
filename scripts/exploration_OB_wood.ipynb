    "The distance between the `margida[wagon]N` line and the `gigir[chariot]N` line is 7 (`line`₂ - `line`₁ + `skip`₁:₂ -1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `skip` is computed from the [ORACC](http://oracc.org) variables `extent` and `scope`, which are part of the so-called \\$-line conventions. These conventions are explained in more detail [here](http://oracc.org/doc/help/editinginatf/primer/structuretutorial). A 'strict' \\$-line uses a limited vocabulary to describe the preservation or state of the object on which the text is written. Examples of strict \\$-lines are:,\n",
    "* \\$ beginning of column missing\n",
    "* \\$ 7 lines traces\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples '7' and 'beginning' are the `extent`; 'column' and 'line' are `scope` ('missing' and 'traces' are `state`. The variable 'state' is ignored here - treating 'missing', 'broken', 'traces', etc. all as absence of data).\n",
    "\n",
    "If lines are missing the `extent` variable will indicate the number of missing lines or columns. A line with data has `extent` NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `skip` is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* if the line has data (in `label`, `lemma`, and `base`) `skip` = 0\n",
    "* if `scope` == 'column', or anything other than 'line', `skip` = NaN\n",
    "* if `extent` is a digit, `skip` is the integer version of that digit\n",
    "* if `extent` is 'n' or 'beginning' (or anything other than a digit), `skip` = NaN\n",
    "\n",
    "Because NaN cannot be used in a column of integers, `skip` will become a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note to Erin\n",
    "\n",
    "I am proposing here to introduce a new variable `skip` (rather than adjust the variable `extent`). I think that is clearer to outsiders (and to our future selves). I hope the explanation of how it is done is also clearer. I haven't actually done what I describe here - because it would mess with your datastructure. Essentially, everything remains exactly the same, but what was called `extent` will now be called `skip`. Note that the formula for line distance needs more thought. The number of rows that have some `skip` value needs to be subtracted - there should be some smart way of doing that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could, of course, use `999` instead of `NaN` for `skip` - but I prefer to use `NaN` here and to present the change to `999` as a feature of handing the data off to R."

    "\n",
    "NV: The field `line` is derived directly from the field `id_line`, minus the `id_text` (P-number) element. `Id_line` is a string but `line` is an integer, used to keep the lines in the right order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Why do the first several entries in the DTM start with a number? It looks like these are all words that are unlematized. What do the numbers refer to? Is \"10[na]_na\" different from \"11[na]_na\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "NV: Some of these entries come from P251686 - and they indicate a problem we hadn't seen before. This is a tablet that combines a list of wooden objects with a metrological table. The metrological table shouldn't be here - there are, I believe, a few other such instances."

    "Expert manually determines section boundaries based on knowledge of text type. This approach is the most sound, but does not scale. If we relied on this method, we would not be able to use our workflow with other collections of lexical lists without a time-intensive manual step. This method will be set aside for now. We may, however, want to leave users (assuming there ever are any) the option to read in and use their own section definitions for downstream analyses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Automated based on composite text.**  \n",
    "A composite text is read in and breakpoints in the text are determined based on fuzzy matching of similar words (either in base or lemma). Entries between those breakpoints are assumed to belong to the same section. This method would need to be tested and perhaps supervised to ensure that nonsense sections (a collection of words that don't really belong to any section) aren't grouped together. It may also miss sections that are based not on similarity of words (e.g. \"palm\") but similarity of object type or use (e.g. \"bowl\", \"spoon\", \"cup\"), unless that section is between two sections that are picked up by this method.  \n",
    "\n",
