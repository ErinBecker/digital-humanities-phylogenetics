## Define Sections: 
### Automated based on composite text

The first step in analyzing order of entries within a section must be defining what constitutes a section. We've discussed three methods for defining sections.
1) Expert definition.
2) Automated based on composite text (eg. Q000039).
3) Automated based on entry proximity.

This document implements the second method (automated based on composite text).

A composite text is read in and breakpoints in the text are determined based on fuzzy matching of
similar words (either in base or lemma). Entries between those breakpoints are assumed to belong to
the same section. This method would need to be tested and perhaps supervised to ensure that nonsense
sections (a collection of words that don't really belong to any section) aren't grouped together. It
may also miss sections that are based not on similarity of words (e.g. "palm") but similarity of
object type or use (e.g. "bowl", "spoon", "cup"), unless that section is between two sections that
are picked up by this method.

Based on the following (artificial) Q text, this method would ideally lead to three sections. Lines 1-4 (related to palm), lines 5-8 (related to poplar), and lines 9-14 (related to tree).

1) ŋešnimbar[palm]N
2) ŋešnimbar[palm]N sux:suhuš[offshoot]N
3) deg[collect]V/t sux:ŋešnimbar[palm]N
4) niŋkiluh[broom]N sux:ŋešnimbar[palm]N
5) asal[poplar]N
6) asal[poplar]N sux:kur[mountain]N
7) asal[poplar]N sux:dug[good]V/i
8) numun[seed]N sux:asal[poplar]N
9) ilur[tree]N
10) ad[bush]N
11) kišig[acacia]N
12) kišighar[tree]N
13) samazum[tree]N
14) peškal[tree]N

Our strategy for implementing this method is the following:

1) Calculate the degree of similarity between any two adjacent entries in the source/composite document. This similarity can take two independent forms:
  a) shared character strings in the Sumerian (citation form) or the English (guideword)
  b) shared entire words (citation forms and/or guidewords).
2) Eetermine appropriate cutoff values for similarity that distinguish between sections.
3) Automatically assign a name to each section.
4) Output a file containing the entries present in each section.

We can then use these section definitions to analyze similarities and differences between texts in terms of both section presence / absence patterns and section order.

### Setup
If you haven't already, install and load the required packages. 

```{r}
# install.packages(c("ggplot2", "ggdendro", "reshape", "scales"))
# 
# source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
# biocLite("BiocInstaller")
# biocLite("Rlibstree")

library(ggplot2)
library(ggdendro)
library(reshape)
library(scales)
library(Rlibstree)
```

Note: The "EXTRA" tag indicates a hidden code chunk illustrating an important point about
the data that is tangential to the main thread of the analysis. You can run these
code chunks by setting eval=TRUE and see the code itself by setting echo=TRUE.

## Step 1: Calculate similarity between adjacent entries.

This step relies on defining a number of functions to process and clean entry strings. The following entry will be used to demonstrate these functions:
```{r}
entry = "e[house]N_usan[whip]N_gigir[chariot]N"
print(entry)
```

### Remove uninformative characters from character strings

Some characters in entries are not informative for our purposes and should be excluded from the character count in the longest common substring. The function below removes these characters from the entry string.

```{r echo = TRUE}
clean_kmer = function(x) {
  # get rid of part of speech (follows each "]")
  x = gsub("(\\])[a-zA-Z/]*", "\\1", x)
  
  # get rid of certain punctuation ({}[]_.~)
  x = gsub("\\]", "", x)
  x = gsub("\\[", "", x)
  x = gsub("\\{", "", x)
  x = gsub("\\}", "", x)
  x = gsub("_", "", x)
  x = gsub("\\.", "", x)
  x = gsub("~", "", x)
  x
}
```

#### Example to illustrate function
```{r echo = TRUE}
print(entry)
clean_kmer(entry)
```

### Extract whole words

This method for defining sections relies in part on looking for words shared between entries. These shared words can be citation forms (Sumerian) and/or guidewords (English). The functions below enable us to extract guidewords and citation forms from entries.

```{r echo = TRUE}
get_guidewords = function(line) {
  # extract all guidewords for an entry into character vector
  line = unlist(strsplit(line, "_"))
  line = gsub(".*\\[", "", line)
  line = gsub("\\].*", "", line)
  line = gsub("~", "", line)
  guidewords = line
  guidewords = guidewords[which(guidewords != "na")]
  guidewords
}

get_citation_forms = function(line) {
  # extract all citation forms for an entry into character vector
  line = unlist(strsplit(line, "_"))
  line = gsub("(.*)\\[.*", "\\1", line)
  citation_form = line
  citation_form = citation_form[which(citation_form != "na")]
  citation_form
}
```

#### Example to illustrate functions
```{r echo = TRUE}
print(entry)
get_guidewords(entry)
get_citation_forms(entry)
```

We define a section break as any line pair where overlap in guidewords + citation forms is zero AND the longest shared substring (k) is below a defined cutoff. 

```{r}
def_section_breaks = function(df, cutoff) {
  df$section = NA
  sect_num = 1
  first_section_start = which(df$overlap > 0 | df$k >= cutoff)[1]
  df$section[first_section_start] = sect_num
  section_break = FALSE
  
  for (i in (first_section_start):nrow(df)) {
    if (df$overlap[i] > 0 | df$k[i] >= cutoff) {
      if (section_break == TRUE) { sect_num = sect_num + 1 }
      df$section[i] = sect_num
      section_break = FALSE
    } 
    else { 
      df$section[i] = NA
      section_break = TRUE
    }}
  df
}
```

After defining section breaks, we want to export all sections (with all members of each) to a output file. We will also name each section based on the guidewords from the first entry in that section.

```{r}
extract_sections = function(df, file) {
  # writes all entries present in each section to a file
  section_nums = unique(df$section[!is.na(df$section)])
  sections = data.frame(sapply(section_nums, function(x) x = character(max(table(df$section)) + 1)))
  
  for (i in section_nums) {
    elements = unique(c(df[which(df$section == i),]$line_a, df[which(df$section == i),]$line_b))
    missing = max(table(df$section) + 1) - length(elements)
    elements = c(elements, rep(NA, missing))
    sections[,i] = elements 
    # the guidewords from the first entry in a section is used to name the section
    colnames(sections)[i] = paste(get_guidewords(sections[1,i]), collapse = "_")
  }
  write.csv(sections, file, row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
}
```

The function below wraps around the previously defined functions, reading in an input file, initializing a new data frame to store results, finding section breaks and outputing sections to a new file. It also creates two summary plots.
The first plot shows the number of matching words (overlap) between any consecutive two lines.
The second plot shows the total number of entries in each section.

```{r}
compare_entries = function(infile, cutoff, outfile) {
  name = strsplit(infile, "\\.")[[1]][1]
  df_composite = read.csv(infile, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  df_composite = df_composite[which(grepl("^Q", df_composite$id_line)),]
  # remove lines in df representing missing lines or sections
  empty_lines = which(df_composite$entry == "")
  if (length(empty_lines) != 0) {df_composite = df_composite[-empty_lines,] }
  
  # initialize empty data frame for storing results
  num_rows = nrow(df_composite) - 1
  df_compare = data.frame(line_a = character(num_rows), 
                          line_b = character(num_rows),
                          overlap = numeric(num_rows),
                          kmer = character(num_rows),
                          k = numeric(num_rows),
                          stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  
  for (i in 1:nrow(df_composite) - 1) {
    line_a = tolower(df_composite$entry[i])
    guidewords_a = get_guidewords(line_a)
    citation_form_a = get_citation_forms(line_a)
    
    line_b = tolower(df_composite$entry[i + 1])
    guidewords_b = get_guidewords(line_b)
    citation_form_b = get_citation_forms(line_b)
    
    line_a_clean = clean_kmer(line_a)
    line_b_clean = clean_kmer(line_b)
    kmer = getLongestCommonSubstring(c(line_a_clean, line_b_clean))
    kmer = gsub("[\x80-\xFF]", "", kmer) # get rid of multibyte strings introduced by Rlibstree
    k = nchar(kmer)
    if (length(kmer) == 0) {
        kmer = NA
        k = 0 }
    
    overlap = sum(citation_form_a %in% citation_form_b) + sum(guidewords_a %in% guidewords_b)
    
    df_compare$line_a[i] = line_a
    df_compare$line_b[i] = line_b
    df_compare$overlap[i] = overlap
    df_compare$kmer[i] = kmer
    df_compare$k[i] = k
  }
  plot(df_compare$overlap, pch = ".", main = name, ylab = "# matching words", xlab = "line number")
  df_compare = def_section_breaks(df_compare, cutoff = cutoff)
  plot(table(df_compare$section), main = name, ylab = "# entries in section", xlab = "section")
  extract_sections(df_compare, outfile)
  df_compare
}
```

```{r}

Q1 = compare_entries("data/pass/Q01_par.csv", cutoff = 3, "data/sections/Q01_sections.csv")
Q39 = compare_entries("data/pass/Q39_par.csv", cutoff = 3, "data/sections/Q39_sections.csv")
Q40 = compare_entries("data/pass/Q40_par.csv", cutoff = 3, "data/sections/data/pass/Q40_sections.csv")
Q41 = compare_entries("data/pass/Q41_par.csv", cutoff = 3, "data/sections/Q41_sections.csv")
