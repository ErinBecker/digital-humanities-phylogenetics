# Lists of Trees and Wooden Objects
One of the most frequently attested lists is the list of Trees and Wooden Objects. The earliest versions of this list date to the Old Babylonian period (ca. 1900 - 1600 BCE); the most recent versions date to around the beginning of our era and are occasionally provided with transliteration in Greek. Older versions of the list are unilingual (in Sumerian only), later versions include Akkadian (= Babylonian) translations. By the time of the earliest versions Sumerian was already a dead language. These lists teach vocabulary to learners of the Sumerian language. It can be shown that these (unilingua) lists were, in fact, bilingual in structure, but that only the Sumerian half was written down. Later (bilingual) versions make explicit what is implicit in the earlier versions.

We may divide the history of this list into roughly three periods: Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, and First Millennium.

## Old Babylonian
The best-known version of the Old Babylonian list of trees and wooden objects is the one from [Nippur](http://oracc.org/dcclt/Q000039). This list is attested in some 300 tablets and fragments that all represent some part of this list. A few of these tablets originally had the entire list of about 700 lines. Unfortunately, none of these is preserved completely. Other tablets originally contained extracts (often by students) of between 3 and 200 lines. All these tablets and fragments together have been used to reconstruct the 'standard' list. One can view a [score](http://oracc.org/dcclt/Q000039/score) of the list (including transliteration of all the inidividual sources). It is important to realize that the 'standard' list is an abstraction that never existed in the ancient world. The idea of an unmovable text did exist (although it was unusual), but was not applied to school texts like this list. The collection of extracts, therefore, includes many (minor) variants in sequence, in spelling, and in admission or exclusion of items. In general, further to the end of the list the number of sources decreases and variation increases.

In addition to the Nippur version, there are versions of this list from many other places such as [Ur](http://oracc.org/dcclt/P346714,P346865,P346866), [Isin](http://oracc.org/dcclt/P459217,P459218,P459216), and [Uruk](http://oracc.org/dcclt/P349171,P349173). These local versions all differ from each other and from the Nippur version, but are still recognizable as essentially the same composition. None of these local versions has more than 10 copies (all incomplete). Finally, there about 100 exemplars that have no provenance. They arrived in museums in Europe and the States either early in the twentieth century, when trade in such artifacts was legal, or after the first Gulf war, when looting of archaeological sites (and illegal trade on the antiquities market) became a wide-spread problem in Iraq. Occasionally unprovenanced texts may be associated with known versions. For instance, [BRM 4 29+30](http://oracc.org/dcclt/P250364) may be associated with the main text from [Ur](http://oracc.org/dcclt/P346714) and a text now in the [Kelsey Museum](http://oracc.org/dcclt/P235262) largely alligns with the Isin tradition.

All texts discussed in this section have been edited in DCCLT. The internal chronology of the texts is fairly clear for provenanced material, but usually unclear for other texts (only a few tablets are explicitly dated).

## Middle Babylonian
Although we have a few exemplars of Middle Babylonian lists of trees and wooden objects from the Babylonian heartland, the majority of such texts come from places such as [Ugarit](http://oracc.org/dcclt/lexicallistsperiods/middlebabylonian/ugarit/index.html) and [Emar](http://oracc.org/dcclt/lexicallistsperiods/middlebabylonian/emar/index.html) (in present-day Syria) and [Hattusa](http://oracc.org/dcclt/lexicallistsperiods/middlebabylonian/hattusha/index.html) (in present-day Turkey). Cuneiform had spread throughout the Near East as a language of trade and diplomacy. Interestingly, the city of Emar yields two distinct versions of the list: one unilingual and one bilingual; one closer alligned with Old Babylonian models, the other closer alligned with later versions. Emar and Ugarit traditions tend to be fairly close; the Hattusa tradition seems to be different.

Most texts from this period can be dated and located fairly well. The great majority is available on [DCCLT](http://oracc.org/dcclt).

## First Millennium
Local variation largely disappears in first millennium sources; all sources are now bilingual. The list of trees and wooden objects is *much* longer than its Old Babylonian and Middle Babylonian counterparts were. The sources have not been collected systematically in DCCLT and those that are available have not been linked to a composite texts. The impression is that previous generations of scholars over-emphasized the homogeneity of first millennium scholarly tradition and that in fact there is quite a bit of variation (although certainly much less than in earlier periods).

# Other Lists
The list of Trees and Wooden objects is just one example of a (thematic) lexical lists. Other such lists exist and present their own opportunities and challenges.
