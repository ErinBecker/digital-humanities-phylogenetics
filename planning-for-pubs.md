## Section order within documents analysis
- Want to include both the split and non-split analysis
- Narrative order: defining sections, calculating section order similarity (w/SI), results from that analysis, some discussion of the importance of those results, these results led us to think about splitting the Q text as some of the exemplar traditions split the Q text. After this splitting, the clades are the same, with a few minor reorganizations. Two main clades - Q39A, Q39B, as expected. 

- To present this analysis:
	- Add metadata to mcc trees. Location and period. Use ggtree. (erin)
	- Add bootstrap support values to mcc trees. (erin)
	- Recover from github the non-split trees. (erin)
	- Document the methods. (erin)
	- Document the results. (niek)
	- Re-rooting the mcc-tree to display the Q39A, Q39B major clades (ggtree). (erin)
	- Finalize the code for publication / sharing. (erin)
	- Discussion of the significance of the results. (niek)

## Presence absence of entries within document


## Generalizability of these methods for other lexical texts
- Lemmatization of animal texts. (Niek)
- Running the same code. 
- Analyzing the output. 
- Writing it up.
