Benchmarks/Timeline:      
- Friday 11/3
  - Erin 
    - [ ] clean up the section presence/absence code, move to R markdown, and bookstrap
    - [ ] look into changing trees from cladograms to dendrograms
    - [ ] look into adding bootstrap support values to trees (from existing calculations)
  - Niek
    - [ ] look at existing trees for dtm analysis and make notes about relationships / interpretation

### To Do (section order):
- (For efficiency) get rid of self-self comparisons and duplicate pairs in all_pairs_SI df.
- Calculate maximum SI for any given k and use that to define distance measure (this depends on document length).
- Incorporate "top" and "bottom" of documents where known.
- Implement Niek's method for comparing sections that appear multiple times within a document. 
- Add outlier texts. 
- Exclude sections that are "garbage" sections (X.1, X.2). (But check that these are garbage first.)
- Incorporate items from Q text that were not assigned to sections - add these to the section preceding the item.
- Make the distance trees. 
- Incorporate provenience and period in output. 
- Fix issue that very short documents (eg 2 sections) have low self-self SI.
