    - [ ] Clean up explanatory text
    - [ ] Bootstrap
    - [ ] Build consensus tree
    - [ ] Hyperlink documents in tree (?)
    - [ ] Convert tree to phylogram
    - [ ] Add bootstrap support values to tree nodes

2) Grouping documents by section similarity

3) Quality testing
    a) Agreement among methods for Q39 corpus.
    b) Agreement among methods for other corpuses.
    c) Quality of section definitions for Q39 corpus.
    d) Quality of section definitions for other corpuses.
    e) Agreement with previous hypothesis and known relationships.
    f) Effect of text length on results and quality of results.  
  
Benchmarks/Timeline:      
- Friday 11/3
  - Erin 
    - [ ] clean up the section presence/absence code, move to R markdown, and bookstrap
    - [ ] look into changing trees from cladograms to dendrograms
    - [ ] look into adding bootstrap support values to trees (from existing calculations)
  - Niek
    - [ ] look at existing trees for dtm analysis and make notes about relationships / interpretation
