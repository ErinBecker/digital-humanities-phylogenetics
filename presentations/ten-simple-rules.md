## Ten Simple Rules for Collaborating with Jupyter Notebooks
- Practice Modularity - when should things go in different notebooks, when in different cells (small cells)?
    - chunk notebooks, each collaborator works on his/her own
    - create intermediate input/output files
- Comment your Code (document what you're doing)
- Provide examples - when writing functions, show some sample input/output (provide a test case)
- Use the right kernel
- Avoid mixing languages
    - If you must do this, anticipate difficulties
    - What were some of our problems? How could we solve those?
- Be Persistent  (installing packages, passing data objects between languages)
- Ask Questions  
- Use version control but . . .  
  - Avoid Merge Conflicts (or know how to handle them!) - Using Git to manage notebooks is hard
  - Hard to work on the same notebook - how would this be possible? Or is it?
  - similtaneous vs sequential collaboration
- Know where your packages are installing
- Anticipate hidden errors when working outside of Python
- Re-run your notebook (for people used to working with scripts, cell independence can present problems)
- Anticipate differences (between Jupyter Notebooks and the platform you're used to working in)
    - Have adaptable code-writing practices (be willing to change the way you write code to take advantage of functions of Jupyter notebooks)
- Meet in person if possible (or meet regularly in some way)
    - Your mode of working may be different than your collaborators  
    - Why is this important?
- How do you call a notebook from another GitHub repo?
