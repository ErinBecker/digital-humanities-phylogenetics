# Names of Trees and Dendrograms

Ancient cuneiform scribal education in the Old Babylonian  (ca 1,800 BCE) and Middle Babylonian (ca 1,300 BCE) periods included the copying of long lists of Sumerian words (an ancient language already by that time). Versions of the list of Trees and Wooden objects come from Nippur, Isin, Uruk, Emar, Ugarit, and other places; many exemplars derive from the antiquities market and have no known provenance.

Lists of Trees and Wooden objects typically include more or less the same categories of words (trees, parts of chariots and plows, wooden vessels, etc.), but differ significantly from each other in many textual details. Scholars of cuneiform lexical lists have attempted to reconstruct the transmission history of these compositions by evaluating relative textual similarity.

We propose to use phylogenetic methods to reconstruct and interpret the development of these lists over time and through geographical space by building several hierarchical clustering models. In the process we develop measurements for textual distance based on vocabulary, based on order of sections, and based on order of items within a section.

Our talk will highlight the results as well as the process of our collaboration.
