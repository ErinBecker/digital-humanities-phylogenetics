# TITLE
## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 Versions of lexical lists in OB and MB
- factor **temporal** distance
- factor **geographical** distance
- temporal and geographical distance are related to **textual** distance (explain the concept of textual distance).
Is it possible to create a **measure** of textual distance that might indicate geographical or temporal distance/proximity?

### 1.2 Phylogenetics
- measuring distance between genes
- using distance measurements for building a phylogenetic tree
- strong and weak aspects of the analogy
- strong: lists; changes over time
- weak: evolution of lexical texts is not linear

### 1.3 Previous research
BRM 29 + 30 from Ur? (diss. Niek)
KM text from Isin? (diss. Niek)
Nuzi text related to Emar (M. Civil)
MB Nippur text related to Emar (Peterson)
Lessons learned:
- for **longer** texts: order of **sections** may be strong indicator of connection
- for **shorter** texts (Civil, Peterson) order of **items** is useful
- **rare** items or sections are stronger indicators than common ones
> [dcclt/P272557](http://oracc.org/dcclt/P272557) and [dcclt/P388082](http://oracc.org/dcclt/P388082) are identical 3-line texts. Related or coincidence? Contain rare entries.
- **spelling** of items may occasionally be of interest (is FLP text from Isin?; spelling of entries in Ugarit/Emar)

### 1.3 Jupyter Notebooks
brief instructions for where to find the notebooks and how to run them

## 2 Acquiring and Structuring Data
- something about ORACC, JSON
- compare entries (not words)
- compare lemmas, not forms
