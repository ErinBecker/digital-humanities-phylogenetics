# Lists of Trees and Wooden Objects
One of the most frequently attested lists is the list of Trees and Wooden Objects. The earliest versions of this list date to the Old Babylonian period (ca. 1900 - 1600 BCE); the most recent versions date to around the beginning of our era and are occasionally provided with transliteration in Greek.

We may divide the history of this list into roughly three periods: Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, and First Millennium.

## Old Babylonian
The best-known version of the Old Babylonian list of trees and wooden objects is the one from [Nippur](http://oracc.org/dcclt/Q000039). This list is attested in some 300 tablets and fragments that all represent some part of this list. A few of these tablets originally had the entire list of about 700 lines. Unfortunately, none of these is preserved completely. Other tablets originally contained extracts (often by students) of between 3 and 200 lines. All these tablets and fragments together have been used to reconstruct the 'standard' list. One can view a [score](http://oracc.org/dcclt/Q000039/score) of the list (including transliteration of all the inidividual sources). It is important to realize that the 'standard' list is an abstraction that never existed in the ancient world. The idea of an unmovable text did exist (although it was unusual), but was not applied to school texts like this list. The collection of extracts, therefore, includes many (minor) variants in sequence, in spelling, and in admission or exclusion of items. In general, further to the end of the list the number of sources decreases and variation increases.

In addition to the Nippur version, we have versions of this list from many other places such as Ur
