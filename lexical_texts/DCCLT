## DCCLT
Many lexical texts are available on the Digital Corpus of Cuneiform Lexical Texts ([DCCLT](http://oracc.org/dcclt)) website. This site also has some introductory pages.

The text that is most approrpiate for experimentation is the [list of trees and wooden objects](http://oracc.org/dcclt/Q000039). The edition is a *composite* edition, meaning that it combines many (often broken) extracts into one edition. All these broken fragments come from Nippur - and presumably they represent the 'Nippur version.' The left pane gives a list of sources that relate to this version.

In addition to the Nippur version there are many local versions - often represented by only one tablet - sometimes a few. Those are also listed in the left pane (under 'Parallels'). Some of these are only three lines long, others have substantial amount of text.

Texts from DCCLT can be scraped with a scraper that is available at [Digital-Assyriology](https://github.com/niekveldhuis/Digital-Assyriology/tree/master/Scrape-Oracc).
