## Nicholas Matzke: Evolution of anti-evolutionists
http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2015/12/17/10434458/creationism-is-evolving  

Phylogenetic approach to anti-evolutionary (creationist) policies in local and state legislation, taking account of pressures (such as federal legislation). The article is very unclear about methodology - one should probably consult the original Science article.

## Mike Kestemont: Hildegard von Bingen and her Secretary
http://www.mike-kestemont.org/  

Author attribution: were these documents written by Hildegard von Bingen or by her secretary? Based on usage of function words such articles, prepositions. Not immediately applicable to Sumerian sources - but very interesting. Mike Kestemont also does 'n-gram' analysis - where n-gram refers to the number of characters (not words).

## Folgert Karsdorp, Antal van den Bosch: Roodkapje (Little Riding Hood)
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/6/160071  

Analysis of some 300 versions of Little Riding Hood in Dutch, creating a network of dependencies. Based on distance measurements, based on bag-of-words approach (many words in common = small distance). Very interesting for the network theory behind it. The BOW ignores word order, which is not appropriate for the current project. Distance and network are most intruiging.
