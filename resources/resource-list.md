## Nicholas Matzke: Evolution of anti-evolutionists
http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2015/12/17/10434458/creationism-is-evolving  

Phylogenetic approach to anti-evolutionary (creationist) policies in local and state legislation, taking account of pressures (such as federal legislation). The article is very unclear about methodology - one should probably consult the original Science article.

## Mike Kestemont: Hildegard von Bingen and her Secretary
http://www.mike-kestemont.org/  

Author attribution: were these documents written by Hildegard von Bingen or by her secretary? Based on usage of function words such articles, prepositions. Not immediately applicable to Sumerian sources - but very interesting. Mike Kestemont also does 'n-gram' analysis - where n-gram refers to the number of characters (not words).

## Folgert Karsdorp, Antal van den Bosch: Roodkapje (Little Red Riding Hood)
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/6/160071  

Analysis of some 300 versions of Little Riding Hood in Dutch, creating a network of dependencies. Based on distance measurements, based on bag-of-words approach (many words in common = small distance). Very interesting for the network theory behind it. The BOW ignores word order, which is not appropriate for the current project. Distance and network are most intruiging.

## Kellen Funk and Lincoln Mullen: dependencies among 19th century American legal codes (Field Codes)
http://lmullen.github.io/civil-procedure-codes/  

Similarities between field codes to detect dependencies, working with 5-grams (see their [working paper](http://lmullen.github.io/civil-procedure-codes/talks/dh-working-group/Funk-Mullen.Migration-Field-Code.working-paper.pdf)) and Jaccard similarity score. The dependencies between codes are not wholesale, but rather based on sections. That is, a code may borrow sections from various other codes. The result is a network of codes (with NeW York at the heart), but also graphs that show the origin of each section in a single code. The full scripts are available on Github (in R).

## Jamshid J. Tehrani: The Phylogeny of Little Red Riding Hood
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078871  

Analysis of 58 versions of two related fairy tales: "Little Red Riding Hood" and "the Wolf and the Kids." The study takes a distincly phylogenetic perspective, asking how these versions depend on each other. The analysis is based on identification of motifs and characters (I believe by hand-coding them). The recorded stories come from Europe, Middle East, Africa and the Far East. The analysis shows that "Little Red Riding Hood" and "The Wolf and the Kids" are clearly separate branches (or clades). The third branch, which comprises the Far Eastern stories, references elements of both stories, which is interpreted as a later conflation of the two.
The analysis uses three different statistical approaches: 1. Cladistic analysis searching for the 'Most Parimonous Tree'; 2. Bayseian inference and 3. NeighborNet. Each of these approaches has statistics to describe the strength or probability of the solution found. Of these three, NeighbornNet may be most interesting because it allows for overlap and intersection.
