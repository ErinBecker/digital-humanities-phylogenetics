Author attribution: were these documents written by Hildegard von Bingen or by her secretary? Based on usage of function words such articles, prepositions.

Analysis of some 300 versions of Little Riding Hood in Dutch, creating a network of dependencies. Based on distance measurements, based on bag-of-words approach (many words in common = small distance). Very interesting for the network theory behind it. The BOW ignores word order, which is not appropriate for the current project. Distance and network are most intruiging.
