Before next meeting:

Erin: 
- [ ] Add metadata to trees. 
- [ ] Run new Q39 data through scripts (DTM and section order). 
- [ ] Writing.
- [ ] After Niek lematizes stuff re-run through 04b_analyze_section_order.Rmd

Before Monday 2/5:

Niek:
- [ ] Check whether theres anything to add or remove from the other corpora (data/text_IDs).
- [ ] See whether to lematize some of the other texts. 
- [ ] Look into whether we need to split documents from other corpora. 

Erin:
- [X] Run each of the other corpora through 04_define_sections.Rmd  
- [X] Run each of the other corpora through 04b_analyze_section_order_R.Rmd  
    Note: only the following number of documents are present with eight or more sections.
    - Q01 - 1
    - Q40 - 4
    - Q41 - 6
    - Q42 - 1
- [ ] Add text to intro and methods section, as well as images, for paper (based on poster).

    f) Effect of text length on results and quality of results.    
  
Benchmarks/Timeline:      
- Friday 11/3
  - Erin 
    - [ ] clean up the section presence/absence code, move to R markdown, and bookstrap
    - [ ] look into changing trees from cladograms to dendrograms
    - [ ] look into adding bootstrap support values to trees (from existing calculations)
  - Niek
    - [X] look at existing trees for dtm analysis and make notes about relationships / interpretation


Other
### To Do (section order):
- (For efficiency) get rid of self-self comparisons and duplicate pairs in all_pairs_SI df.
- Calculate maximum SI for any given k and use that to define distance measure (this depends on document length).
- Incorporate "top" and "bottom" of documents where known.
- Implement Niek's method for comparing sections that appear multiple times within a document. 
- Exclude sections that are "garbage" sections (X.1, X.2). (But check that these are garbage first.)
- Incorporate items from Q text that were not assigned to sections - add these to the section preceding the item.
- Make the distance trees. 
- Incorporate provenience and period in output. 
- Fix issue that very short documents (eg 2 sections) have low self-self SI.
