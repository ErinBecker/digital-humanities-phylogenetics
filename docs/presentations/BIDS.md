# BIDS talk â€¦. title?

Erin Becker and Niek Veldhuis

## Outline

- Cuneiform Lexical Texts

  * used in scribal teaching


  * flexible
  * variance in time and space
  * how do they relate to each other?

- Cooperation 1: Assyriology and Genetics

  * conceptualization (what types of variation?)
  * translation (what is the parallel problem in phylogenetics)
  * instrumentalization (how to make the concept computable)
  * coding (yes, do it)

- Cooperation 2: Python and R in Jupyter Notebooks

  * mixing R and Python: Jupyter magic (got us in trouble)
  * modular: R notebooks and Python notebooks (multiple advantages)

- Some results: Dendrograms and Interpretations
