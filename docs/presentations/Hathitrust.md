Ancient cuneiform scribal education in the Old Babylonian  (ca 1,800 BCE) and Middle Babylonian (ca 1,300 BCE) periods included the copying of long lists of Sumerian words (an ancient language already by that time). Versions of the list of Trees and Wooden objects come from Nippur, Isin, Uruk, Emar, Ugarit, and other places; many exemplars derive from the antiquities market and have no known provenance. The texts are available inn the Digital Corpus of Cuneiform Lexical Texts ([DCCLT](http://oracc.org/dcclt)) on the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus ([ORACC](http://oracc.org)) platform.

Lists of Trees and Wooden objects typically include more or less the same categories of words (trees, parts of chariots and plows, wooden vessels, etc.), but differ significantly from each other in many textual details. Scholars of cuneiform lexical lists have attempted to reconstruct the transmission history of these compositions by evaluating relative textual similarity.

Evolutionary biologists also use relative similarity of "texts" (DNA sequences) to reconstruct "transmission history" (genetic relatedness). We therefore adopt phylogenetic methods borrowed from evolutionary biology to reconstruct and interpret relationships of these lists (both over time and through geographical space). In the process, we develop metrics for describing distance among texts based on vocabulary, order of textual sections and order of items within sections. 

Our talk will highlight the results as well as the process of our collaboration.
